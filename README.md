# SpaceX Launch Analysis - IBM Data Science Capstone

## Project Overview
This repository contains the final capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The objective of this project is to analyze SpaceX launch data using Python, APIs, and machine learning techniques to predict the success of future launches.

## Dataset
The data used in this project is retrieved from the SpaceX API and supplemented with additional datasets. The dataset includes information about launch sites, booster versions, payload mass, orbit types, and launch outcomes.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Collection**
   - Extract launch data from the SpaceX API
   - Collect additional datasets for analysis

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values (e.g., using mean imputation)
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical features
   - Normalize and standardize numerical data

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize trends in launch success rates
   - Analyze relationships between payload mass and orbit types
   - Identify factors influencing successful launches

4. **Machine Learning Model**
   - Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) to predict launch success
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **SpaceX API**
- **IBM Watson Studio**



## Results
The analysis provides insights into factors that influence launch success. The machine learning model predicts launch outcomes based on historical data, helping to optimize future launches.
